# ourworld


A mobile app designed to help everyone learn about the world.

Thanks to posts published in the app in either text or video format, users can interact with them and briefly learn about various topics.

Our objective with OurWorld is to help people develop their general knowledge, and their sense of curiosity little by little by exploring a few posts every day. We want to give people the initiative to learn.

We aim for conciseness. For the most of us, our time is limited. Therefore, we see our platform to display posts which only take between 2 and 10 minutes to go through.
